Spring and Hibernate course from udemy.  This github project is for my personnal use. This is an extract from the extraordinary online course of Chad Darby (from luv2code). I highly recommand you this course, if you want to buy it, just follow this link : https://www.udemy.com/spring-hibernate-tutorial/learn/v4/overview
